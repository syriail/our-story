# OUR STORY

Our Story aka. Ourstory project is a **multi-lingual, flexible and expandable** archive of collections of stories. Visitors can search this archive for stories. The archive does not only support simple text search, but rahter semantic search.

## Story

A story is a material collected by researchers and mostly told by someone. A story could be oral history, folklore songs, fairy tale..etch

Stories could be backed with video, audio or image media such as a film recording the story teller while telling the story.

## Collection

Stories are collected in a context of projects carried out by organizations interested in heritage and oral history of people.

All stories collected in a context of a project are organized in collection. Hakawati Collection is an example of such project in which more than 400 stories were collected.

# Features

The archive has the following main features:

- **Expandable:** Collections and stories could be added dynamically.
- **Flexible:** Collection-specific fields can be defined dynamically, so these fields appear only in stories which belong to this collection.
- **Multi-lingual:** A new language could be added with a minimum technical efforts.
- **Semantically Searchable:** Archive supports semantic search according to each language's characterstics such as plural recognition in Arabic.
- **Role-based Functionalities:** Users can perform actions based on their role in the system and their role in each collection.

## Testing

The backend is ready to be unit and integration tested without the need of a Frontend

To test the backend and make sure it meets the requirements, please do the following steps:

- Checkout the project from the repository
- Then `cd our-story/ourstory-backend`
- Run `npm i --save`to install dependencies
- Add a file named `stage.ts` which is used by `serverless.ts` to specify the `profile`and `stage``
  The file should be like:

  ```
  const stage = {
    stage:'dev',
    profile: 'udacity'
  }
  export default stage

  ```

### Unit Test

- In a seperate terminal run `sls dynamodb start`. This will start local dynamodb and seed the initial data
- In current terminal run `npm test`

### Integration Test Offline and Online

The folder ourstory-backend contains Postman collection named `Our-Story.postman_collection.json`.
This collection contains all sort of required tests

- Test create, update and delete story
- Get upload url and upload file to S3 bucket
- Test get colections according to user id
- Test request validation
- Test authorization

The collection contains many tokens to test with different user id, different user's role and finally to test marlformed token.

#### Test Offline

To run Postman collection offline:

- In terminal `cd ourstory-backend`
- Run `sls offline start`. This will start dynamodb local, seed the initial data in the tables, start S3 local service and create the required bucket, and start the server
- Import the collection in postman
- Set the variable {{host}} = http://localhost:3000/dev in Postman
- Run tests in at the collection level or Run each request individually

#### Test Online

- Import the collection in postman
- Set the variable {{host}} = https://3c6itjpmv1.execute-api.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/dev in Postman
- Run tests in at the collection level or Run each request individually

#### Test Online

> The following sections are intended to be a full documentation of the system.

# System Parts

The system consists of three **_separate_** parts (sub-projects)

## Backend

The server-side components and services which provide the core funcionalities and logic of the system.

## Manager

A web application where authorized users can define collections, add stories and translate stories

## Frontend

Where visitors search for stories and get the results accordingly.

# System Architecture

Manager and Frontend are web applications built using React framework and they connect to backend by REST APIs.

The main focus of this section is the backend architecture since it contains the components and logic of the system.
